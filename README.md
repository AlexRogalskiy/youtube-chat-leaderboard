## ToDos

[x] Get messages (and data) from the page
[ ] Continue to get messages every minute OR detect when new element is added (#fluke gets 4 points today!)
[x] Save the data somewhere
[ ] Play with the data

## Future todos

[ ] Check how to bypass the headless issue of Browser not being the newer version (check by using your own Brave)

## User/App flow

1. User sends a messages in the chat
2. The message will be checked by the app to see if on of the conditions is applied:
    - #earlygang
    - #lategang
    - #secretkey
    - #bonuspoint (this will be awarded manually by me)
3. If there is a point to be given the message + user + point will be stored
4. User can check a public leaderboard w/ the scores
5. I can delete the leaderboard whenever I want (cuz I'm the boss ðŸ˜Ž) - mostly at the end of the month when the winners are choosen
